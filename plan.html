					<p><b>Self-drive</b></p>
					<p>Liverpool compact size and diversity of landscapes makes it ideal for touring. Major roads between cities and country towns are well signposted.</p>
					<p> Rules in the Liverpool : </p>
					<p>You must be able to read a vehicle number plate, in daylight, from a distance of 20 metres – or 20.5 metres where there’s an old style number plate. And if you need to wear glasses (or contact lenses) to do it, you must wear them at all times while driving.</p>
					<p>You must obey signs used by school crossing patrols.</p>
					<p>You must obey all traffic light signals and traffic signs giving orders – and that includes temporary signals & signs.</p>
					<p>You’re only allowed to flash your headlights to let other road users know that you are there. You could be prosecuted for using them to convey any other message – or to intimidate other road users.</p>
					<p>Car horns can be used only while your vehicle is moving and you need to warn other road users of your presence. Sounding your horn aggressively can be an offence, and the Highway Code says you must not use it while stationary on the road or when driving in a built-up area between the hours of 11.30pm and 7am – except when another road user poses a danger.</p>
					<p>All sidelights and rear registration plate lights must be lit between sunset and sunrise.</p>
					<p>You must not use any lights in a way which would dazzle or cause discomfort to other road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders</p>
					<p>It’s against the code to leave a parked vehicle unattended with the engine running or leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily while the vehicle is stationary on a public road.</p>
					<p>An obvious one, and one that annoys most of us being overtaken by speeding drivers – you must not exceed the maximum speed limits for the road and for your vehicle. The presence of street lights generally means that there is a 30 mph speed limit, unless otherwise specified</p>
					<p>That one-way street might look like a tempting short cut, but the Code says you must always travel in the direction indicated by signs.</p>
					<p>You must not drive on or over a pavement, footpath or bridleway except to gain lawful access to property – or in the case of an emergency.</p>
					<p>You must not throw anything out of a vehicle, including food, paper or cigarette ends.</p>

					<p><b>Driving In Liverpool</b></p>
					<p>Liverpool welcomes safe drivers. We want you to have a fantastic holiday in Liverpool and this means staying safe on our roads.Here are some advice :</p>
					<p>Your journey may take longer than you expect – allow extra time</p>
					<p>When planning a long drive have a good night's sleep before the trip, especially after a long flight to Australia, and where possible, share the driving with your companions.</p>
					<p>Wear a seatbelt when travelling in a vehicle.</p>
					<p>Drive within the limits and to the conditions</p>
					<p>Keep your eyes on the road, not the scenery. If you want to stop and look at the view, make sure you pull completely off the road in a place that is safe to stop.</p>
					<p>Drivers are not permitted to use a handheld mobile phone when driving – it's against the law. If you need to make a call or send a text, pull over at a rest area or in a safe place.</p>
					<p>Get to know the road rules, signs and markings before you drive.</p>
					<p>Don't drive impaired by drugs or alcohol.</p>
					<p>Choose the safest vehicle.</p>
					<p>If driving slowly, pull over where it is safe and let faster traffic pass.</p>
